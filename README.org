#+TITLE: Claude Config
#+AUTHOR: Pedro Delfino
#+DESCRIPTION: The leash I keep my AI on.

* What's Here

*keybindings.json* - Because I refused to unlearn several years of
Emacs muscle memory. =Ctrl+X Ctrl+E= or death.

*settings.json* - Global permissions for the home directory scope.
All tools allowed except pushing, deploying, and publishing. Also
configures hooks for sound notifications (gong on stop, looping ring
on waiting for input, knock sound when asking a question) and Slack
pings when Claude needs attention.

*settings.local.json* - Project-level permissions with broader
wildcards, explicit Clojure MCP tool access, and enabled MCP JSON
servers for frontend/backend REPLs.

*memory/* - Claude's auto-memory files. Symlinked from
=~/.claude/projects/-Users-pedro/memory=. Where Claude writes down
what it learned so it doesn't make the same mistakes twice. In theory.

* Philosophy

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  if (action.isLocal && action.isReversible) { return "go wild, robot
    friend"; } else if (action.couldEmbarrassMePublicly) { return "let's
    talk about this first"; }
#+END_SRC

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone git@github.com:pdelfino/claude-config.git
  ~/projects/claude-config ln -sf
  ~/projects/claude-config/keybindings.json ~/.claude/keybindings.json
  ln -sf ~/projects/claude-config/settings.json
  ~/.claude/settings.json
  ln -sf ~/projects/claude-config/settings.local.json
  ~/.claude/settings.local.json
  ln -sf ~/projects/claude-config/memory
  ~/.claude/projects/-Users-pedro/memory
#+END_SRC

* The Deal

| Claude Can           | Claude Cannot            |
|----------------------+--------------------------|
| Read anything        | =git push=               |
| Write anything       | Deploy to prod           |
| Run any command      | Merge PRs                |
| Delete my files      | Mass destruction via k8s |
| Break things locally | Break things publicly    |

Basically: make all the mess you want in my house, just don't invite
the neighbors to see it.
