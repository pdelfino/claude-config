#+TITLE: Claude Config
#+AUTHOR: Pedro Delfino
#+DESCRIPTION: The leash I keep my AI on.

* What's Here

*keybindings.json* - Because I refused to unlearn 20 years of Emacs muscle memory. =Ctrl+X Ctrl+E= or death.

*settings.local.json* - Claude can do whatever it wants... except yeet code to production or push to GitHub. Trust, but verify. Actually, trust but =deny: ["Bash(git push:*)"]=.

* Philosophy

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
if (action.isLocal && action.isReversible) {
  return "go wild, robot friend";
} else if (action.couldEmbarrassMePublicly) {
  return "let's talk about this first";
}
#+END_SRC

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:pdelfino/claude-config.git ~/projects/claude-config
ln -sf ~/projects/claude-config/keybindings.json ~/.claude/keybindings.json
ln -sf ~/projects/claude-config/settings.local.json ~/.claude/settings.local.json
#+END_SRC

* The Deal

| Claude Can          | Claude Cannot              |
|---------------------+----------------------------|
| Read anything       | =git push=                 |
| Write anything      | Deploy to prod             |
| Run any command     | Merge PRs                  |
| Delete my files     | Mass destruction via k8s   |
| Break things locally| Break things publicly      |

Basically: make all the mess you want in my house, just don't invite the neighbors to see it.
